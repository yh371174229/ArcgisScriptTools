DEVELOP ArcGIS Toolbox
======================

This toolbox contains script tools for ArcGIS written in Python. The tools automate geoprocessing routines that utilize NASA remotely sensed data.



Installation and Setup
----------------------

To begin, install the following requirements:

 * [NumPy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/)
 * [SciPy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/)
 * [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)
 * [H5py](http://code.google.com/p/h5py/)

*note*: ArcGIS 10 uses Python 2.6 and ArcGIS 10.1 uses Python 2.7 . So choose your installer accordingly.

To use the toolboxes, download the files as a zipped folder. Unzip and navigate to the folder in ArcCatalog. The toolbox should appear and instructions for each tool will be available in the tool's help section.

Notes
-------------
Sometimes you will need to manually set the source script for each tool. This can be accomplished in the "Source" tab of the tool's "Properties"

Spaces in pathnames can cause problems for all of these tools. Make sure all filenames and containing folders do not contain spaces.
