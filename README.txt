DEVELOP ArcGIS Toolbox
-------------------------------------

This toolbox contains script tools for ArcGIS written in Python. The tools execute various remote sensing processes.

To use the toolboxes, download the files as a zipped file. Unzip and navigate to the folder in ArcCatalog. The toolbox should appear and instructions will be available in the tools help section.

Some of the tools are dependent on the following packages that must be installed.
*note* ArcGIS 10 uses Python 2.6 and ArcGIS 10.1 uses Python 2.7 . So choose your installer accordingly.

Numpy - http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.7.1/

Scipy - http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.12.0/

H5py  - http://code.google.com/p/h5py/downloads/list
